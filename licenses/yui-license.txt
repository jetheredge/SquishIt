Sources of Intellectual Property Included in the YUI Library
Where not otherwise indicated, all YUI content is authored by Yahoo! engineers and consists of Yahoo!-owned intellectual property. YUI is issued by Yahoo! under the BSD license above. In some specific instances, YUI will incorporate work done by developers outside of Yahoo! with their express permission.

Below is the explicit list of external (non-Yahoo) sources of intellectual property in YUI, along with the licensing terms that pertain to those sources of IP:

Douglas Crockford's JSON parsing and stringifying methods: In the JSON Utility, Douglas Crockford's JSON parsing and stringifying methods are adapted from work published at JSON.org. The adapted work is in the public domain. 
Robert Penner's animation-easing algorithms: In the Animation Utility, YUI makes use of Robert Penner's algorithms for easing. 
Geoff Stearns's SWFObject: In the Charts Control and the Uploader, YUI makes use of Geoff Stearns's SWFObject v1.5 for Flash Player detection and embedding. More information on SWFObject can be found here (http://blog.deconcept.com/swfobject/). SWFObject is (c) 2007 Geoff Stearns and is released under the MIT License (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)
